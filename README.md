# panstamp-java

The panstamp-java library provides Java programmers the ability to write  desktop and server applications that can interface with panStamp Arduino RF networks. 

## What are panStamps? 

PanStamps are autonomous low-power wireless modules programmable from the Arduino IDE and made for telemetry and control projects. 

You can read all about them [on their commercial site](http://www.panstamp.com/) and [their wiki](https://github.com/panStamp/panstamp/wiki). There's a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/panStamp/panstamp) and a [community forum.](http://www.panstamp.org/forum/)
