# panstamp-java

The panstamp-java library provides Java programmers the ability to write  desktop and server applications that can interface with panStamp Arduino RF networks. 

## What are panStamps? 

PanStamps are autonomous low-power wireless modules programmable from the Arduino IDE and made for telemetry and control projects. 

You can read all about them [on their commercial site](http://www.panstamp.com/) and [their wiki](https://github.com/panStamp/panstamp/wiki). There's a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/panStamp/panstamp) and a [community forum.](http://www.panstamp.org/forum/)


## Versions

The current stable version is *1.2*. For more information about different releases, see  [Releases](https://github.com/GideonLeGrange/panstamp-java/releases).

This library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, be it bug fixes or other improvements. If you fix or change something, please submit a pull request. If you want to report a bug, please open an issue. 

You're also welcome to join the discussion in the [Java thread on the panStamp forum](http://www.panstamp.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=24).
